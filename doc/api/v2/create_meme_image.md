The Meme Captain API is currently experimental and may change.

# Creating a Meme Image

HTTP POST a JSON body to http://memecaptain.com/gend_images. For this
request set the `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers to `application/json`.
Example JSON body:

```json
{
  "src_image_id": "MDyuQg",
  "private": false,
  "captions_attributes": [
    {
      "text": "top text",
      "top_left_x_pct": 0.05,
      "top_left_y_pct": 0,
      "width_pct": 0.9,
      "height_pct": 0.25
    },
    {
      "text": "bottom text",
      "top_left_x_pct": 0.05,
      "top_left_y_pct": 0.75,
      "width_pct": 0.9,
      "height_pct": 0.25
    }
  ]
}
```

## Required Fields

* src_image_id
* text
* top_left_x_pct
* top_left_y_pct
* width_pct
* height_pct

## Optional Fields

* private - true if the meme is private (defaults to false), a private meme will not show up on public pages on the web site

## Caption Coordinates

The top left corner of the image has the coordinates (0, 0).

- top_left_x_pct - the x coordinate of the top left corner of the caption as a percentage of the total image width
- top_left_y_pct - the y coordinate of the top left corner of the caption as a percentage of the total image height
- width_pct - the width of the caption as a percentage of the total image width
- height_pct - the height of the caption as a percentage of the total image height

## Polling

If the request is accepted you will receive an HTTP 202 Accepted response.
The `Location` header will contain a URL to poll. The same URL will also be
in the `status_url` field of the response body.

Poll the URL returned in the `Location` header until it returns 303 (See
Other). When it returns 303, the image is finished processing and the
`Location` header will contain the URL of the image. Under normal
circumstances creation of the image should be instantaneous.

If there was an error processing the image, the `error` field in the
JSON response will contain an error message. If the `error` field is null,
no error has occurred. If there is an error message, the client should stop
polling.

### Polling Responses

* 200 - The image is still being processed. Keep polling.
* 303 - The image is finished. Its URL is in the `Location` header.
* 404 - Image not found.

## Error Responses

If the src_image_id in the initial POST request references a source image
that is not found or is not finished being created, the response code will
be 404.

If there are validation errors the response code will be 422 Unprocessable Entity. The body will contain JSON with the errors.

## Shell script example

On every meme image page, there is an `API` button that shows a shell script
that recreates that image using the API. This script can also be used to
determine text position parameters for an API request.

## Ruby example

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

require 'json'
require 'net/http'

json_request = {
  src_image_id: 'MDyuQg',
  private: false,
  captions_attributes: [
    {
      text: 'top text',
      top_left_x_pct: 0.05,
      top_left_y_pct: 0,
      width_pct: 0.9,
      height_pct: 0.25
    },
    {
      text: 'bottom text',
      top_left_x_pct: 0.05,
      top_left_y_pct: 0.75,
      width_pct: 0.9,
      height_pct: 0.25
    }
  ]
}

create_uri = URI('http://memecaptain.com/gend_images')
create_request = Net::HTTP::Post.new(create_uri)
create_request['Accept'] = 'application/json'
create_request['Content-Type'] = 'application/json'
create_request.body = json_request.to_json

Net::HTTP.start(create_uri.hostname, create_uri.port) do |http|
  create_response = http.request(create_request)

  poll_uri = URI(create_response['Location'])
  poll_request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(poll_uri)
  10.times do
    poll_response = http.request(poll_request)
    puts "poll response #{poll_response.code}"
    if poll_response.code == '303'
      puts poll_response['Location']
      break
    end
    parsed_body = JSON.parse(poll_response.body)
    fail(parsed_body['error']) if parsed_body['error']
    sleep 3
  end
end
```
